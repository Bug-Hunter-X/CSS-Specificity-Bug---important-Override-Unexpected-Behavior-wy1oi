The following CSS code has an uncommon bug related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

The unexpected behavior is that the `.child` element within the `.parent` element will have the color green, not red as one might expect given the `!important` declaration. This is because the specificity of `.parent .child` is higher than that of `.child` alone, causing the `!important` declaration to be overridden.
