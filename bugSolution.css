To solve the unexpected behavior, you need to understand CSS specificity and adjust your code accordingly. Here are a few solutions:

**Solution 1 (Adjust Specificity):**

Instead of relying on `!important`, ensure that the selector for the intended style has higher specificity than any conflicting selector. In this case, it could be:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green !important; /* Higher Specificity */
}
```

**Solution 2 (Use More Specific Selector):**

If you really need to use !important, make sure the selector with !important is sufficiently specific to override any other selectors:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/*This is a solution to solve bug using a class*/
.parent .child.special {
  color: green !important; /* Add a specific class to override */
}
```

**Solution 3 (Avoid !important):**

The best practice is often to avoid `!important` altogether and focus on writing well-structured, specific CSS to prevent such conflicts.  Re-evaluate your styling approach and try to resolve the conflict using standard CSS selectors with appropriate specificity.
